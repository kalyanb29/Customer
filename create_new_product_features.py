#- create binary feature on whether user has bought product before (is this indicated by has_bought_prodid? no)
#- create binary feature on whether product is established or not
#- create feature of probability of rebuy in category, based on how frequent they buy in the category (if they do)
#  -take space between buys, take mean and then calculate chance of buy in next quarter? 
#  -estimate probability of rebuy as poisson dist variable, remember that offer date is also a buy-date.
#  -what about no buys in category? 0 prob
#  -mle of lambda in exponential distribution is 1/mean(times between event)
#    -> number of events in time [0,60] follow poisson distribution with parameter 60/mean(times between event)
#    -> probability of P(more than one event) = 1-P(one event) = 1- (60/mean(times between event)*exp(60/mean(times between event)))
#- create feature on if they only bought the product we are interested in, in category
#- create feature on how many different products in the category the user has bought
